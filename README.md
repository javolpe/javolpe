### Hello! Thanks for visiting my Github profile! :wave:

I'm a backend web developer with a background in sales, mangement, training & coaching, and a few entrepreneurial ventures mixed in there.
I enjoy working collaboratively/pairing or independently as part of a team.  I strive for clear expectations and teamwork in all I do.  Passionate about building things and making connections.  In the tech world that translates directly to building/testing API's, databases, and data handling with other like minded individuals to make people's live easier and more enjoyable.
